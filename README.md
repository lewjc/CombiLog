# CombiLog

CombiLog is a logging aggregation tool that can act as a central hub for all of your logs! It combines your logs to save you digging across Containers and Virtual Machines.

## Planned Features (v1.0)

- User Interface to view incoming logs from multiple services
- Allow filtering of logs based on service and log type (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG, TRACE).
- Allow viewing realtime and previous logs
- Completely dockerised deployment
